# Real-time Image Identification with CNN

This project demonstrates a real-time image identification application using Streamlit, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It captures or uploads images, applies data augmentation techniques, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identification. The project, named **Trained Man Identification**, is designed for identifying trained individuals based on previously captured images.

## Features

- **Live Image Capture:** Capture images in real-time using a connected webcam.
- **Image Upload:** Upload images for processing and testing.
- **Data Augmentation:** Automatically performs grayscale, brightness, and saturation adjustments on images to increase data diversity.
- **CNN-based Classification:** Identifies images based on trained data using a CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Accessible through a sidebar and interactive buttons for different operations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `streamlit`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Trained-Man-Identification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Trained-Man-Identification
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Sidebar Menu
   - **Enter Image Name:** Provides a unique folder name for storing processed images.
   - **Capture Image:** Captures an image using the webcam and saves it with augmentation applied.
   - **Upload Image:** Uploads an image from the device, saves it with augmentation applied, and displays it on the main page.

### 2. Main Page
   - **Test Live Photo:** Captures an image and uses the trained CNN model to identify the object.
   - **Test Upload Image:** Uploads a new image and identifies it using the trained CNN model.
   - Displays results on the main Streamlit page.

## Code Overview

### `Image_Identification` Class
Initializes directories for saving images based on a provided folder name.

### `data_augmentation` Function
Applies grayscale, brightness, and saturation adjustments to the captured/uploaded image and saves it in the specified folder.

### `capture_image` Function
Captures an image from the webcam, displays it in Streamlit, and applies data augmentation if a folder path is provided.

### `data` Function
Loads and preprocesses images and labels from folders for model training.

### `apply_CNN` Function
Defines a CNN model, trains it on the augmented images, and applies it to identify the provided input image.

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time inference without re-training the model.
- Optimize the model architecture for faster predictions.
- Improve data augmentation techniques for diverse image variations.
